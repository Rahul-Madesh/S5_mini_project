# AI-Powered Smart Mess Meal Pre-Booking and Food Waste Reduction Agent

A production-ready prototype built for college mess dining management. This system solves food wastage and preparation uncertainty in residential institutions by gathering **menu preferences** and **self-reported meal intentions** from students (both home hostellers and external visitors) ahead of meal service.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
In typical educational institutions, mess kitchens either overproduce food (leading to massive wastage) or underproduce (causing shortages). This prototype introduces two non-invasive digital touchpoints:
1. **Interactive Menu Preference Poll**: Four curated meal options allowing students to express preference for tomorrow's menu.
2. **Meal Intention Self-Reporting**: An in-app notice asking students whether they plan to eat the upcoming meal, with a strict cutoff lock before kitchen prep begins.
3. **Kitchen Admin Dashboard**: Real-time analytics breaking down preferences, intention rates, home vs. external student distributions, and an individual audit log.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, `react-router-dom`, Vanilla CSS design system with glassmorphism, responsive grid layouts, and live progress bars.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (CommonJS), `cookie-parser`, `helmet`, `cors`, `express-rate-limit`, `zod` schema validator, `bcryptjs` (cost factor 12), `jsonwebtoken`.
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0+ using `mysql2/promise` with connection pooling and atomic SQL transactions.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites & Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or later (v25+ supported)
- **MySQL**: MySQL Server 8.0 or MariaDB 10.5+ running locally or remotely on port 3306

---

### 2. Database Initialization

#### Option A: Automated Setup Script (Recommended)
Run the idempotent setup script which creates the database, executes `schema.sql`, seeds the 4 menu options, and creates the admin account:
```bash
cd smart-mess/backend
npm run setup:db
```

#### Option B: Manual MySQL CLI
If preferred, you can initialize the database using the MySQL command line client:
```bash
# 1. Log in to MySQL
mysql -u root -p

# 2. Create the database
CREATE DATABASE smart_mess_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
USE smart_mess_db;

# 3. Source schema and seed files
source E:/S5_mini_pro/smart-mess/database/schema.sql;
source E:/S5_mini_pro/smart-mess/database/seed.sql;

# 4. Exit
EXIT;
```
After manual sourcing, run `npm run setup:db` to securely hash and register the admin account.

## 🚀 How to Run the Application

### Mode 1: Development Mode (Vite Dev Server + Express API)
Run both backend and frontend concurrently for hot module replacement:

1. **Start Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd smart-mess/backend
   npm run dev
   # Server runs on http://localhost:5000
   ```

2. **Start Frontend** (in a second terminal):
   ```bash
   cd smart-mess/frontend
   npm run dev
   # Vite dev server runs on http://localhost:5173 (proxies /api to :5000)
   ```

3. Open **`http://localhost:5173`** in your browser.

---

### Mode 2: Single-Server Production Mode
In production mode, the Express backend serves the pre-compiled React frontend directly from `frontend/dist`:

```bash
cd smart-mess
npm run build
npm start
```
Open **`http://localhost:5000`** in your browser. The entire application runs from one single command.

---

## 🧪 Automated End-to-End Test Suite
Run the comprehensive automated test suite to verify all endpoints, database constraints, security guards, and error cases:

```bash
cd smart-mess
npm run test:api
```

### Tested Scenarios:
- `GET /api/health` and `GET /api/config` (home college prefill)
- Registration schema validation (rejection of short passwords, malformed emails)
- Duplicate email conflict handling (`409 Conflict`)
- Home student vs. external visitor registration
- Login failure with timing-safe dummy hash comparison (`401 Unauthorized`)
- Tokenless protected route rejection (`401 Unauthorized`)
- Non-admin access to `/api/admin/*` forbidden (`403 Forbidden`)
- Fetching active poll with exactly 4 Indian mess menu items
- Atomic vote casting and prevention of race conditions
- Duplicate vote enforcement via database unique constraint (`409 Conflict`)
- Live vote count and percentage calculation
- Meal intention notification retrieval (`GET /api/notifications/meal-intent`)
- Answering meal intention ("Yes, I'll eat" vs "No, I won't")
- Changing meal intention response prior to cutoff (`PUT /api/meal-intent`)
- Rejection of invalid intention bodies (non-boolean values, incorrect date)
- Admin detailed poll results, voter records, and home vs. external breakdown
- Admin meal intention metrics (Yes, No, No-response counts and response rate)
- Admin poll closing and reopening (`PATCH /api/admin/polls/:id`)
- Rejection of votes after poll is closed (`409 Poll closed`)
- Unknown API routes return standard JSON 404

## 🔒 Security Design
1. **Password Hashing**: Passwords hashed using `bcryptjs` with cost factor 12. Password policies enforced: 8-72 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 digit.
2. **Timing Attack Defense**: Non-existent user login attempts are compared against a pre-computed dummy hash in constant time.
3. **JWT in httpOnly Cookie**: Tokens are stored strictly in `httpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` cookies (with `Secure` enabled in production). Tokens are never exposed to `localStorage` or JavaScript, preventing XSS-based session hijacking.
4. **Startup Secret Validation**: Server halts execution immediately on startup if `JWT_SECRET` is missing, shorter than 32 characters, or uses known placeholder words.
5. **Role Escalation Protection**: The `/api/auth/register` endpoint strictly assigns the `student` role. Admin accounts can only be provisioned via the secure server-side setup script.
6. **Rate Limiting**: `express-rate-limit` throttles brute-force login and registration attempts to a configurable maximum (default 20 requests per 15 minutes).
7. **HTTP Protection**: Configured with `helmet` for defense headers and explicit CORS origin whitelisting.
8. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Built entirely with `mysql2/promise` using parameterized statements (`?`) and connection pooling. Database names and admin credentials in setup scripts undergo strict regex validation.

## ⚖️ Known Limitations & Honesty Rules
1. **Self-Declared Student Type**: The distinction between "home" hostellers and "external" visitors is currently self-reported at registration. In a university production deployment, this could be validated against official institutional email domains (`@college.edu`) or campus single-sign-on (SSO).
2. **Preference vs. Demand**: Menu votes represent preference distribution among students who participated in the poll. They do **not** forecast total meal quantities.
3. **Intentions vs. Actual Attendance**: Meal intention responses are self-declared plans, not biometric check-ins or attendance scans. The kitchen admin dashboard labels counts as "self-reported intentions" and explicitly displays the response rate alongside counts.

## 🔮 Future AI Module Design (Documented Future Scope)
> **Note**: This is an architectural proposal for future research. No fake AI or simulated prediction code is included in this prototype.

### Goal:
To build an AI demand prediction engine that forecasts precise headcounts and ingredient consumption for mess kitchens, directly minimizing food surplus and waste.

### Required Training Data:
1. **Historical Mess Consumption Records**: Actual kilograms of food prepared vs. kilograms consumed vs. waste logs over 6–12 months.
2. **Temporal & Calendar Features**: Day of week, meal type (breakfast/lunch/dinner), academic schedules, semester examination periods, festival breaks, and weekends.
3. **Weather Conditions**: Local temperature, rainfall index, and extreme weather events that alter hostel dining habits.
4. **Pre-Booking Touchpoint Data**: Menu preference vote tallies and meal intention response rates collected by this platform.
5. **Special Campus Events**: Sports tournaments, cultural fests, symposiums, and visiting delegations.

### Proposed Machine Learning Architecture:
- **Model**: A hybrid architecture utilizing **Gradient Boosted Decision Trees** (XGBoost/LightGBM) for tabular feature importance combined with **Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)** or **LSTM** time-series forecasting.
- **Objective Function**: An asymmetric loss function (e.g., custom quantile loss) that penalizes food waste (overproduction) while strictly bounding shortages below a 2% tolerance threshold.
- **Continuous Learning**: By continuously comparing pre-booking intention data with actual kitchen post-service consumption weights, the model will learn institutional dining patterns over time.

## ⏱ 5-Minute Project Review Demo Script

| Time | Stage | Action & Talking Points |
|---|---|---|
| **0:00 - 0:45** | **Introduction & Problem Statement** | Open the browser at `http://localhost:5173`. Explain to the evaluators: *"Hostel mess facilities face severe food waste due to unpredictable attendance and preference uncertainty. Our prototype introduces an AI-ready pre-booking agent with dual touchpoints: menu preference voting and meal intention reporting."* |
| **0:45 - 1:45** | **Student Registration (Home vs. External)** | Click **Register**. Explain: *"Our system supports both home hostellers and visiting guests."* Select **Home Student**; point out that the college name is pre-filled from `/api/config`. Register `Aarav Kumar`. Then log out, click Register again, select **External Student**, and show how visitors can type their visiting college name (`PSG Tech`). |
| **1:45 - 2:45** | **In-App Meal Intention Notification** | Log in as `Aarav Kumar`. Point out the banner at the top: *"Will you eat mess food for LUNCH tomorrow?"* Explain: *"This is our single in-app notification. No spam, no external SMS."* Click **"Yes, I'll eat"**. Notice updates to show the confirmed choice. Demonstrate the **"Change answer"** button and explain the automated cutoff deadline enforcement. |
| **2:45 - 3:30** | **4-Option Menu Poll & Duplicate Block** | Scroll to the menu poll. Point out the 4 realistic Indian mess options (Thali, Deluxe Combo, Biryani, Millet Pulao). Click **"Vote For This"** on Biryani. The UI shows *"You voted for Dum Vegetable Biryani Bowl"*, the button disables, and the live progress bar updates. Show the evaluator the honesty disclaimer: *"Votes show preference distribution, not an absolute demand forecast."* |
| **3:30 - 4:30** | **Admin Dashboard & Analytics** | Sign out and log in with the admin credentials (`admin@mess.local`). Navigate to the **Admin Dashboard**. Highlight: (1) Total registered students count, (2) Total poll votes with home vs. external breakdown, (3) Real-time percentages per menu option, (4) Self-reported meal intention rate and Yes/No breakdown, and (5) The individual voter audit log. |
| **4:30 - 5:00** | **Poll Lifecycle & Future AI Scope** | In the Admin Dashboard, click **"Close This Poll"**. Switch to another window as a student and show that voting is blocked with a clear notice. Conclude by summarizing the future AI module design documented in the README: how intention and preference data will feed a gradient boosted demand forecasting model once real waste logs are accumulated. |
